      description: |
        This endpoint retrieves a list of matrices from the workspace.
        If there are multiple versions of a matrix, only the latest version (based on the `modified` property) will be returned.
        In addition, the `state`, `includeRevoked`, and `includeDeprecated` filters are only applied to the latest version of a matrix.
