      description: |
        This endpoint retrieves a list of identities from the workspace.
        If there are multiple versions of an identity, only the latest version (based on the `modified` property) will be returned.
        In addition, the `state`, `includeRevoked`, and `includeDeprecated` filters are only applied to the latest version of an identity.

        This endpoint creates a new identity in the workspace.
        If the `stix.id` property is set, it creates a new version of an existing identity.
        If the `stix.id` property is not set, it creates a new identity, generating a STIX id for it.
