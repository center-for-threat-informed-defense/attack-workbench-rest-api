# Workspace Data Model

The Federated ATT&CK workspace supports the following ATT&CK object types
(with the corresponding STIX types where applicable):
- Collection (x-mitre-collection)
- Matrix (x-mitre-matrix)
- Technique (attack-pattern)
- Group (intrusion-set)
- Software (malware or tool)
- Mitigation (course-of-action)
- Tactic (x-mitre-tactic)
- Data Source (x-mitre-data-source)
- Identity (identity)
- Marking Definition (marking-definition)
- Relationship (relationship)
- Collection Index

### attackObjects Collection

Most objects are stored in the `attackObjects` collection.
This includes objects of the types listed above, except for the Collection Index object.
Objects in the `attackObjects` collection follow a consistent pattern,
though each type has a number of properties that are specific to that type.

The `stix` property holds a STIX formatted object and contains the data that is eligible to be exported.
The `workspace` property holds the data that is used within the workspace to manage the object. 

### Unique Identifiers

For most objects, the combination of `stix.id` and `stix.modified`
uniquely identify an instance of an object. The `stix.modified` property
distinguishes versions of the `stix.id` object.

The `_id` property also uniquely identifies an object,
but is not used outside of the MongoDB database.
`_id` is necessary because there is no natural property that uniquely identifies an
object by itself. `stix.id` is only unique when combined with `stix.modified`.

### Mongoose Discriminator

Objects of multiple types are stored in the `attackObjects` collection.
This is done to facilitate simpler lookup of objects that may be of different types,
for example, an object that is the `src_ref` or `target_ref` of a `relationship` object.
The Mongoose discriminator capability supports storing multiple object types in
a single collection, while still using a schema that is specific to each object type.

The `__t` property is created and managed by Mongoose to distinguish between the different types of
objects stored in the `attackObjects` collection.

### Sample Technique

A technique is stored in the database in the following format:
```json
