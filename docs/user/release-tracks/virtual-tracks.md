# Virtual Release Tracks

## Overview

Virtual release tracks are computed aggregations of standard release tracks. They provide a way to compose releases from multiple source tracks without duplicating object tracking, reducing mental overhead and storage requirements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Virtual tracks **compute** their contents from component standard tracks
- Only reference **tagged snapshots** from standard tracks (never drafts)
- Maintain their own **independent snapshot history and versioning**
- Create snapshots **manually or on schedule** (never event-driven)
- All snapshots start as **drafts** and must be explicitly tagged

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Different Cadences for Different Object Types

```
Standard Tracks (source of truth):
  - GroupsMonthly: intrusion-set objects, releases monthly
  - TechniquesQuarterly: attack-pattern objects, releases quarterly
  - SoftwareBiannual: malware + tool objects, releases twice yearly

Virtual Track (aggregation):
  - EnterpriseTwiceAnnual: Aggregates all three, releases twice yearly
```

**Workflow:**
1. Each standard track releases independently on its own schedule
2. Enterprise virtual track snapshots twice yearly (Jan 1, July 1)
3. Each snapshot captures the **latest tagged release** from each component track
4. Enterprise team reviews snapshot, then tags it as a release

**Benefit:** Groups can release 12 times/year while Enterprise releases 2 times/year, without tracking Groups in both places.

### Scenario 2: Modular Content Organization

```
Standard Tracks:
  - CoreTactics: All tactics
  - CoreTechniques: All attack-patterns
  - CoreGroups: All intrusion-sets
  - CoreSoftware: All malware + tools
  - CoreMitigations: All course-of-action objects

Virtual Tracks:
  - EnterpriseATT&CK: Aggregates all five
  - MobileATT&CK: Aggregates relevant subsets with mobile domain filter
  - ICSATT&CK: Aggregates relevant subsets with ICS domain filter
```

**Benefit:** Maintain objects by type in standard tracks, compose domain-specific releases as virtual tracks.

## Virtual Track Types

### Type: `virtual`

Virtual tracks are identified by `stix.type = "virtual"` in their schema.

```javascript
{
  // Identity
  id: "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  type: "virtual",  // Distinguishes from standard tracks

  // Snapshot metadata
  snapshot_id: "2024-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  modified: "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  version: null,  // Draft snapshot (or "14.0" if tagged)

  // Release track metadata
  name: "Enterprise ATT&CK",
  description: "Virtual aggregation of Enterprise content",
  created: "2024-01-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  created_by_ref: "identity--uuid",
  object_marking_refs: ["marking-definition--uuid"],

  // Objects in this snapshot (Virtual tracks use a 2-tier system)
  members: [],      // Successfully synced objects from component tracks
  quarantine: [],   // Conflicting objects that require manual resolution

  // Composition rules (how to build this virtual track)
  composition: {
    component_tracks: [
      {
        track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
        resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
        priority: 1,  // Required and unique; lower number = higher priority
        filters: {
          object_types: ["intrusion-set"],
          // Additional filters...
        }
      },
      {
        track_id: "release-track--uuid-2",
        resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
        priority: 2,
        filters: {
          object_types: ["attack-pattern"]
        }
      }
    ],

    deduplication: {
      strategy: "prioritize_latest_object"  // See Deduplication Strategies below
    }
  },

  // Snapshot schedule configuration
  snapshot_schedule: {
    mode: "manual"  // "manual" | "cron" | "dates"
  },

  // Configuration
  config: {
    candidacy_threshold: "reviewed",
    auto_promote: true
  },

  version_history: []
}
```

## Composition Resolution

### Resolution Strategies

#### 1. `latest_tagged`

Always resolves to the most recent **tagged snapshot** from the component track.

```javascript
{
  track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
  resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
  priority: 0
}

// At virtual snapshot time (e.g., March 1, 2024):
// 1. Query GroupsMonthly for all snapshots where version !== null
// 2. Sort by modified DESC
// 3. Take first result
// → Resolves to GroupsMonthly v5.2 (released Feb 15, 2024)
```

**Use case:** "Always include the latest Groups release in Enterprise"

#### 2. `specific_version`

Resolves to a specific semantic version from the component track.

```javascript
{
  track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
  resolution_strategy: "specific_version",
  version: "5.0",
  priority: 0
}

// At virtual snapshot time:
// 1. Query GroupsMonthly for snapshot where version === "5.0"
// → Resolves to GroupsMonthly v5.0 (regardless of when snapshot occurs)
```

**Use case:** "Pin Enterprise to Groups v5.0 until we're ready to upgrade"

#### 3. `specific_snapshot`

Resolves to a specific snapshot by its `modified` timestamp.

```javascript
{
  track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
  resolution_strategy: "specific_snapshot",
  snapshot: "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z",
  priority: 0
}

// At virtual snapshot time:
// 1. Query GroupsMonthly for snapshot where modified === "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z"
// → Resolves to that specific snapshot
```

**Use case:** "Lock to exact snapshot for reproducibility"

Component selectors are strict and strategy-specific:

- `latest_tagged` rejects both `version` and `snapshot`.
- `specific_version` requires `version` and rejects `snapshot`.
- `specific_snapshot` requires `snapshot` and rejects `version`.

Unknown component properties are rejected with `400 Bad Request`; they are
not silently discarded.

### Component Track Sync Rules

Virtual tracks **only sync from component tracks' `members` tier** (`x_mitre_contents`). This ensures that virtual tracks only aggregate objects that have been officially released in their source tracks.

**Important:**
- Virtual tracks reference **tagged snapshots only** (never drafts)
- Virtual tracks pull objects from **`members` tier only** (never staged or candidates)
- This guarantees that virtual track releases are composed of stable, released content

**Rationale:** Since virtual tracks can only reference tagged snapshots from component tracks, it makes sense to only pull from the `members` tier, which contains the released objects from those snapshots.

### Filters

Each component track can specify filters to limit which objects are included:

```javascript
filters: {
  // Only include specific object types
  object_types: ["intrusion-set", "malware"],

  // Match the pinned revision's x_mitre_domains values. Both public names
  // ("enterprise") and STIX names ("enterprise-attack") are accepted.
  domains: ["enterprise", "mobile"]
}
```

Domain filters hydrate the exact revisions pinned by the component's tagged
snapshot; they do not inspect the latest database revision. An object with
multiple matching domains is included in each corresponding virtual track.
Objects without `x_mitre_domains` are excluded when a domain filter is set.
The primary Enterprise, ICS, and Mobile matrices are the exception: published
ATT&CK data identifies their domain through
`external_references[].external_id`, so virtual filtering uses that established
matrix fallback.

`object_types` values are case-sensitive canonical Workbench STIX type names.
When the property is present, it must contain at least one value and cannot
contain duplicates. Omit `object_types` to include every type. The filter reads
the type prefix from each resolved member's `object_ref`, so a newer database
revision cannot replace the exact revision pinned by the component release.
Unsupported values return `400 Bad Request`.

`stix_pattern` is not part of the current request schema and is not
implemented. Filter objects are strict, so misspelled or unsupported keys such
as `domain` fail with `400 Bad Request`; use the plural `domains`.

### Deduplication Strategies

When multiple component tracks contain the same object (same `stix.id`), the
materialization records one duplicate object. Contributions with the same
`modified` timestamp are the same exact revision, so they collapse to one
member and do not constitute a conflict. The configured strategy is applied
only when multiple distinct revisions remain. Four strategies are available:

Each surviving member is attributed to one component. The active strategy
selects that source where applicable, with the component's required unique
priority providing a stable tie-breaker. As a result, the sum of
`component_snapshots[].objects_contributed` equals
`composition_resolution.summary.total_objects`.

#### 1. `prioritize_latest_object`

Keep the version with the newest `modified` timestamp, regardless of which component track it came from.

```javascript
deduplication: {
  strategy: "prioritize_latest_object"
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// GroupsMonthly v5.2 has:
//   intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-02-01T10:00:00Z

// MobileGroups v3.1 has:
//   intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-01-15T14:00:00Z

// Virtual track sync result:
//   → Uses 2024-02-01 version from GroupsMonthly (newer object)
//   → Added to virtual track's members
```

**Use case:** "Always use the most recently updated object, regardless of source"

#### 2. `prioritize_latest_snapshot`

Keep the version from the component track whose resolved snapshot has the newest `modified` timestamp. This can result in syncing **older** versions of objects if they came from a more recently released snapshot.

```javascript
deduplication: {
  strategy: "prioritize_latest_snapshot"
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// GroupsMonthly v5.2
//   - Snapshot created: 2024-02-15T10:00:00Z
//   - intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-02-01T10:00:00Z

// MobileGroups v3.1
//   - Snapshot created: 2024-01-10T10:00:00Z
//   - intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-02-05T10:00:00Z

// Virtual track sync result:
//   → Uses 2024-02-01 version from GroupsMonthly
//   → GroupsMonthly snapshot is newer (2024-02-15), even though APT1 object is older
//   → Added to virtual track's members
```

**Use case:** "Trust the more recently released track, even if individual objects are older"

#### 3. `prioritize_higher_priority`

Keep the version from the component track with the higher priority (lower priority number). Every component track requires a unique, non-negative integer priority.

```javascript
composition: {
  component_tracks: [
    {
      track_id: "release-track--authoritative",
      resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
      priority: 1,  // Higher priority (lower number = higher priority)
      filters: { object_types: ["intrusion-set"] }
    },
    {
      track_id: "release-track--supplemental",
      resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
      priority: 2,  // Lower priority
      filters: { object_types: ["intrusion-set"] }
    }
  ],
  deduplication: {
    strategy: "prioritize_higher_priority"
  }
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// Authoritative track (priority: 1) has:
//   intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z

// Supplemental track (priority: 2) has:
//   intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-02-15T10:00:00Z

// Virtual track sync result:
//   → Uses 2024-01-01 version from Authoritative track
//   → Priority 1 wins, even though object is older
//   → Added to virtual track's members
```

**Use case:** "One track is authoritative; always prefer its version over others"

**Important:** Component tracks cannot have duplicate priority values. The API will reject composition configurations with conflicting priorities.

#### 4. `quarantine`

Don't automatically choose a version. Instead, store **both** versions in the virtual track's `quarantine` tier for manual review and resolution.

Only distinct revisions are quarantined. If several components contribute the
same exact revision, it remains one ordinary member. If two distinct revisions
are present and either is contributed repeatedly, quarantine contains one
entry for each distinct revision rather than one entry per component.

```javascript
deduplication: {
  strategy: "quarantine"
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// GroupsMonthly has: intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-02-01
// MobileGroups has: intrusion-set--APT1, modified: 2024-01-15

// Virtual track sync result:
{
  members: [
    // APT1 is NOT included here
    // ... other non-conflicting objects
  ],
  quarantine: [
    {
      object_ref: "intrusion-set--APT1",
      object_modified: "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z",
      source_track_id: "release-track--groups-monthly",
      source_track_name: "Groups Monthly",
      source_snapshot_version: "5.2",
      conflict_reason: "duplicate_object"
    },
    {
      object_ref: "intrusion-set--APT1",
      object_modified: "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
      source_track_id: "release-track--mobile-groups",
      source_track_name: "Mobile Groups",
      source_snapshot_version: "3.1",
      conflict_reason: "duplicate_object"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use case:** "Conflicts require human review; don't automatically choose a version"

**Follow-up workflow:** Users review the quarantined objects and manually
promote one exact version to `members`. Promotion creates a new draft and
removes every quarantined alternative for that object. Other quarantined
objects remain until separately resolved.

### Virtual Track Two-Tier System

Unlike standard release tracks (which use a three-tier system: candidates → staged → members), virtual tracks use a simplified **two-tier system**:

1. **`members`** - Successfully synced objects from component tracks
   - Contains objects that were either:
     - Synced from component tracks without conflicts, OR
     - Manually promoted from quarantine after conflict resolution
   - These objects are included in published STIX bundles
   - No duplicate objects allowed (unique by `stix.id`)

2. **`quarantine`** - Conflicting objects requiring manual resolution
   - Contains objects that couldn't be automatically resolved due to conflicts
   - Only populated when using `quarantine` deduplication strategy
   - Can contain multiple versions of the same object (different `modified` timestamps)
   - NOT included in published STIX bundles
   - Requires manual intervention to resolve

**Comparison to Standard Tracks:**

| Feature | Standard Track | Virtual Track |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Tiers | candidates, staged, members | quarantine, members |
| Object management | Direct (add/remove objects) | Indirect (synced from components) |
| Workflow states | work-in-progress, awaiting-review, reviewed | N/A |
| Auto-promotion | Based on candidacy threshold | N/A |
| Manual promotion | candidates → staged → members | quarantine → members |

**Why only two tiers?**

Virtual tracks aggregate content from component tracks that have already gone through the full workflow (candidates → staged → members). Virtual tracks don't need the intermediate `staged` tier because they're composing already-released content. The only workflow step is resolving conflicts via the `quarantine` tier.

## Virtual Track Snapshot Lifecycle

### 1. Snapshot Creation

Virtual track snapshots are created either **manually** or **on schedule**.

#### Manual Snapshot

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/snapshots/create
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "description": "Q1 2024 Enterprise snapshot"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  "type": "virtual",
  "snapshot_id": "2024-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "modified": "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  "version": null,
  "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",
  "description": "Virtual aggregation of Enterprise content",

  "composition_resolution": {
    "resolved_at": "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
    "component_snapshots": [
      {
        "track_id": "release-track--uuid-1",
        "track_name": "Groups Monthly",
        "track_type": "standard",
        "resolved_snapshot_id": "2024-02-15T10:00:00.000Z",
        "resolved_version": "5.2",
        "strategy_used": "latest_tagged",
        "total_objects_in_source": 47,
        "objects_after_filter": 47,
        "objects_contributed": 47
      },
      {
        "track_id": "release-track--uuid-2",
        "track_name": "Techniques Quarterly",
        "track_type": "standard",
        "resolved_snapshot_id": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
        "resolved_version": "2.1",
        "strategy_used": "latest_tagged",
        "total_objects_in_source": 823,
        "objects_after_filter": 823,
        "objects_contributed": 823
      }
    ],
    "deduplication": {
      "total_objects_before": 870,
      "total_objects_after": 870,
      "duplicates_found": 0,
      "conflicts_resolved": []
    },
    "summary": {
      "total_objects": 870
    }
  }
}
```

**Business Logic:**
1. For each component track in `composition.component_tracks`:
   - Resolve snapshot based on `resolution_strategy`
   - **Validate that resolved snapshot is tagged** (version !== null)
   - Pull objects from component track's **`members` tier only** (`x_mitre_contents`)
   - Apply `filters` to get subset of objects
   - Collect all object references with source metadata
2. Apply deduplication rules across all components:
   - Collapse identical `(object_ref, object_modified)` contributions
   - If no distinct-revision conflicts remain: objects go to virtual track's `members`
   - If conflicts + `quarantine` strategy: both versions go to `quarantine`
   - If conflicts + other strategies: winning version goes to `members`
   - Attribute every surviving member to one deterministic source component
3. Create new virtual track snapshot with:
   - New `snapshot_id` and `modified` timestamp
   - `version = null` (always starts as draft)
   - `members` array (successfully synced objects)
   - `quarantine` array (conflicting objects, if any)
   - `composition_resolution` metadata (what was included)
4. Return snapshot with resolution details

#### Scheduled Snapshot

Virtual tracks can be configured to auto-generate snapshots on a schedule:

```javascript
snapshot_schedule: {
  mode: "cron",
  cron: "0 0 1 1,7 *"  // Jan 1 and July 1 at midnight
}
```

Schedule payloads are strict and mode-specific:

- `manual` accepts only `{ mode: "manual" }`.
- `cron` requires `cron` and rejects `dates`.
- `dates` requires a nonempty `dates` array and rejects `cron`.

Unknown schedule fields return `400 Bad Request`. Standard tracks do not
support `snapshot_schedule`.

The global scheduler must be enabled. Five-field cron expressions and dates
are interpreted in UTC. Each cron occurrence creates a draft while the server
is running; missed cron occurrences are not backfilled. Due dates are durable:
the scheduler recovers them after a restart and persists exactly one draft per
configured timestamp. A failed occurrence is audited and retried once per
scheduler reconciliation interval.

Scheduled drafts follow the same composition resolution, deduplication,
validation, and persistence path as
`POST /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/snapshots/create`. They also include:

```json
{
  "scheduled_materialization": {
    "schedule_mode": "cron",
    "scheduled_for": "2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### 2. Snapshot Review

Before tagging, team reviews the draft snapshot:

```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified?format=workbench&include=all
```

**Response includes:**
- All objects that will be in the release
- Composition resolution details (which component versions were used)
- The exact persisted members and quarantine tiers

### 3. Release Preview

Preview the selected draft against its preceding tagged release:

```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release/preview
```

The summary reports the next version, previous tagged release, type-oriented
before/after counts, and new, updated, removed, and quarantined object counts.
Use `format=workbench` for the literal would-be tagged snapshot or
`format=bundle` for its publication artifact. Previewing does not persist and
never re-resolves composition.

### 4. Snapshot Tagging

Once reviewed, explicitly tag the draft snapshot:

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "increment": "major",  // or "minor", or explicit "version": "14.0"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  "type": "virtual",
  "snapshot_id": "2024-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "modified": "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  "version": "14.0",
  "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",

  "composition_resolution": {
    "resolved_at": "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
    "component_snapshots": [...]
  },

  "version_history": [
    {
      "version": "14.0",
      "tagged_at": "2024-03-05T14:00:00Z",
      "tagged_by": "admin@example.com",
      "snapshot_id": "2024-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
      "component_versions": {
        "release-track--groups-monthly": "5.2",
        "release-track--techniques-quarterly": "2.1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`component_versions` is keyed by immutable component track ID. Its values come
from the selected draft's `composition_resolution`, not from the component
tracks' current releases. If a component advances after this virtual draft was
materialized, the virtual release still records the version that actually
produced its frozen contents. Standard release history entries omit this
virtual-only property.

**Business Logic:**
1. Validate snapshot exists and is a draft (version === null)
2. Calculate/validate version number
3. Set version on snapshot (in-place update)
4. Copy resolved component versions into the virtual release-history entry
5. Add entry to version_history
6. Snapshot is now immutable

### 5. Snapshot Export

Export virtual track snapshot as STIX bundle:

```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified?format=bundle
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "type": "bundle",
  "id": "bundle--uuid",
  "objects": [
    {
      "type": "x-mitre-collection",
      "id": "x-mitre-collection--virtual-uuid",
      "modified": "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
      "x_mitre_version": "14.0",
      "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",
      "x_mitre_contents": [
        { "object_ref": "intrusion-set--APT1", "object_modified": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z" },
        { "object_ref": "intrusion-set--APT2", "object_modified": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" },
        { "object_ref": "attack-pattern--T1234", "object_modified": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z" }
        // ... all 870 objects
      ]
    },
    // ... all 870 actual STIX objects
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The exported bundle is **materialized** - it contains concrete object references, not composition metadata. Consumers see a standard STIX bundle, unaware it came from a virtual track.

## Composition Resolution Details

### Resolution Metadata

Each virtual track snapshot stores metadata about how it was composed:

```javascript
{
  // Identity and snapshot metadata
  id: "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  type: "virtual",
  snapshot_id: "2024-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  modified: "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  version: "14.0",

  // Composition resolution metadata
  composition_resolution: {
    resolved_at: "2024-03-01T10:00:00Z",

    component_snapshots: [
      {
        track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
        track_name: "Groups Monthly",
        track_type: "standard",

        // Which snapshot was used
        resolved_snapshot_id: "2024-02-15T10:00:00.000Z",
        resolved_version: "5.2",

        // How it was resolved
        strategy_used: "latest_tagged",
        filters_applied: {
          object_types: ["intrusion-set"]
        },

        // Statistics
        total_objects_in_source: 47,
        objects_after_filter: 47,
        objects_contributed: 47  // After deduplication
      }
    ],

    // Deduplication report
    deduplication: {
      total_objects_before: 870,
      total_objects_after: 870,
      duplicates_found: 0,
      conflicts_resolved: []
    },

    // Native objects (if any)
    native_objects: {
      candidates_count: 0,
      staged_count: 0,
      members_count: 0
    },

    // Final statistics
    summary: {
      total_objects: 870,
      by_type: {
        "intrusion-set": 47,
        "attack-pattern": 823
      },
      by_tier: {
        "members": 870,
        "staged": 0,
        "candidates": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

#### 1. Component tracks must have tagged snapshots

```javascript
// When creating virtual snapshot
for (const component of composition.component_tracks) {
  const snapshot = await resolveSnapshot(component);

  if (snapshot.version === null) {
    throw new ValidationError(
      `Component track ${component.track_id} resolved to draft snapshot. ` +
      `Virtual tracks can only reference tagged snapshots.`
    );
  }
}
```

**User experience:**
```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-virtual/virtual/snapshots/create

# Error response:
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Cannot create virtual snapshot: component track 'GroupsMonthly' has no tagged releases",
  "details": {
    "component": "release-track--uuid-1",
    "issue": "No tagged snapshots found (all snapshots are drafts)"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Component tracks must be standard tracks

```javascript
// When creating/updating virtual track composition
async function validateComponentsAreStandard(virtualTrack) {
  for (const component of virtualTrack.composition.component_tracks) {
    const track = await getReleaseTrack(component.track_id);

    if (track.type === "virtual") {
      throw new ValidationError(
        `Virtual tracks can only compose from standard tracks. ` +
        `Component track ${component.track_id} is a virtual track.`
      );
    }
  }
}
```

## API Reference

### Create Virtual Track

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/new
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "virtual",
  "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",
  "description": "Virtual aggregation of Enterprise content",

  "composition": {
    "component_tracks": [
      {
        "track_id": "release-track--uuid-1",
        "resolution_strategy": "latest_tagged",
        "priority": 0,
        "filters": {
          "object_types": ["intrusion-set"]
        }
      }
    ],
    "deduplication": {
      "strategy": "prioritize_latest_object"
    }
  },

  "snapshot_schedule": {
    "mode": "cron",
    "cron": "0 0 1 1,7 *"
  }
}
```

### Update Composition

```bash
PUT /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/composition
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "component_tracks": [
    {
      "track_id": "release-track--uuid-1",
      "resolution_strategy": "latest_tagged",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "track_id": "release-track--uuid-2",
      "resolution_strategy": "specific_version",
      "version": "2.0",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Composition requests are strict at every nested level. Unknown composition,
component, filter, or deduplication properties return `400 Bad Request`.
Selector fields must match `resolution_strategy`: `latest_tagged` accepts
neither selector, `specific_version` requires only `version`, and
`specific_snapshot` requires only `snapshot`.
Every component also requires a unique, non-negative integer `priority`.
Referenced tracks must exist and must be standard tracks; these rules are
checked during initial virtual-track creation as well as composition updates.

**Note:** Updating composition creates a pending draft with the new rules and
invalidates any previously materialized contents. The draft has empty
`members` and `quarantine` arrays and `composition_resolution: null`. Run the
virtual snapshot creation operation before attempting release preview or
tagging; those release operations return `409 Conflict` for a pending draft.

### Create Virtual Snapshot

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/snapshots/create
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "description": "Q1 2024 snapshot"
}
```

### Tag Virtual Snapshot

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "increment": "major"
}
```

Release preview uses the same shared path as standard tracks:

```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release/preview
```

Virtual composition is not recomputed during preview or release. The summary
compares the selected persisted draft with the tagged release that immediately
preceded it, reporting members/quarantine counts and new, updated, removed, and
quarantined object counts. Use `format=workbench` or `format=bundle` to inspect
the literal snapshot or publication artifact that would be tagged. The draft
must have a non-null `composition_resolution`, proving that its members and
quarantine tiers were materialized from its current composition.

### Get Virtual Track with Resolved Content

```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/latest?format=workbench&include=all
```

**Query params:**
- `format`: `bundle` | `workbench` | `filesystemstore` (`filesystemstore` is not yet implemented and returns HTTP 501)
- `include`: `members` | `quarantine` | `all`
- `resolve`: `true` (default) | `false` - Whether to resolve composition

**Response when `resolve=true`:**
```json
{
  "id": "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  "type": "virtual",
  "snapshot_id": "2024-03-05T10:00:00.000Z",
  "modified": "2024-03-05T10:00:00Z",
  "version": null,
  "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",

  "resolved_content": {
    "members": [
      {
        "object_ref": "intrusion-set--APT1",
        "object_modified": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z",
        "source_track": "release-track--uuid-1",
        "source_version": "5.2"
      }
      // ... all resolved objects
    ],
    "quarantine": []
  },

  "composition_resolution": {
    "resolved_at": "2024-03-05T10:00:00Z",
    "component_snapshots": [...]
  }
}
```

## Quarantine Management

When using the `quarantine` deduplication strategy, conflicting objects are stored in the virtual track's `quarantine` tier. Users must manually resolve these conflicts:

**View quarantined objects:**
```bash
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/latest?include=quarantine
```

**Manually promote a quarantined object to members:**
```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/quarantine/promote
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "object_ref": "intrusion-set--11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "object_modified": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Effect:**
- Requires the exact `(object_ref, object_modified)` pair to be quarantined
- Creates a new draft with the selected revision in `members`
- Replaces any prior member revision with the same `object_ref`
- Removes every version of the same object from `quarantine`
- Leaves the materialized source snapshot and its composition-resolution
  provenance unchanged
- Reconciles object back-references to the new latest snapshot
- Allows the next snapshot tagging operation to include the selected revision

Malformed requests and attempts against standard tracks return `400 Bad
Request`. Selecting a revision that is not quarantined returns `404 Not Found`
without creating a snapshot.

## Hybrid Model: Virtual Track + Native Objects

Virtual tracks can optionally have **native objects** in addition to composed content. This is an advanced use case where a virtual track needs to include objects that don't exist in any component track:

```javascript
{
  id: "release-track--uuid-virtual",
  type: "virtual",

  // Composed from standard tracks
  composition: {
    component_tracks: [
      {
        track_id: "release-track--uuid-1",
        resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
        priority: 1
      },
      {
        track_id: "release-track--uuid-2",
        resolution_strategy: "latest_tagged",
        priority: 2
      }
    ],
    deduplication: {
      strategy: "prioritize_latest_object"
    }
  },

  // PLUS virtual track's own native members
  native_members: [
    {
      object_ref: "marking-definition--enterprise-only",
      object_modified: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],

  // Final result after sync
  members: [
    // ... objects from component tracks
    // ... plus native_members
  ],
  quarantine: []
}
```

**Use case:** Enterprise track includes Groups and Techniques from standard tracks, PLUS Enterprise-specific marking definitions or custom objects that don't belong in any component track.

**When virtual snapshot is created:**
1. Resolve composed content from component tracks (goes to `members` or `quarantine`)
2. Merge with virtual track's `native_members` (goes to `members`)
3. If any `native_members` conflict with composed objects, apply deduplication strategy

**Note:** This is an advanced feature. Most virtual tracks should only use composition without native members.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Standard Tracks

```bash
# Create standard tracks for each object type
POST /api/release-tracks/new
{
  "name": "Groups Monthly",
  "description": "All intrusion-set objects"
}

# Add existing Groups as candidates
POST /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-1/candidates
{
  "object_refs": ["intrusion-set--APT1", "intrusion-set--APT2", ...]
}

# Tag initial release
POST /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-1/snapshots/latest/release
{ "version": "1.0" }
```

### Phase 2: Create Virtual Track

```bash
POST /api/release-tracks/new
{
  "type": "virtual",
  "name": "Enterprise ATT&CK",
  "composition": {
    "component_tracks": [
      {
        "track_id": "release-track--uuid-1",
        "resolution_strategy": "latest_tagged",
        "priority": 0
      },
      {
        "track_id": "release-track--uuid-2",
        "resolution_strategy": "latest_tagged",
        "priority": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "snapshot_schedule": {
    "mode": "dates",
    "dates": ["2024-07-01T00:00:00Z", "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"]
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Create First Virtual Snapshot

```bash
# Manually trigger first snapshot
POST /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-virtual/virtual/snapshots/create

# Review draft snapshot
GET /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-virtual/snapshots/:modified

# Tag as Enterprise v14.0
POST /api/release-tracks/release-track--uuid-virtual/snapshots/:modified/release
{ "version": "14.0" }
```

### Phase 4: Ongoing Workflow

```
Timeline:

Jan 15: GroupsMonthly releases v1.1 (updated Groups)
Feb 15: GroupsMonthly releases v1.2 (more updates)
Mar 15: TechniquesQuarterly releases v2.1 (updated Techniques)
Apr 15: GroupsMonthly releases v1.3

July 1: Enterprise scheduled snapshot triggers
  → Resolves GroupsMonthly v1.3 (latest tagged)
  → Resolves TechniquesQuarterly v2.1 (latest tagged)
  → Creates draft snapshot

July 5: Team reviews draft, tags as Enterprise v14.1
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Snapshot Caching

Since virtual snapshots are immutable once created, cache resolved content:

```javascript
const cacheKey = `virtual-snapshot:${trackId}:${modified}:resolved`;

const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return cached;

const resolved = await resolveVirtualSnapshot(trackId, modified);
await cache.set(cacheKey, resolved, { ttl: 3600 });  // 1 hour cache
```

### 2. Lazy Resolution

For `GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/latest` (latest snapshot), only resolve if:
- Query param `resolve=true` is specified
- Format requires resolution (e.g., `format=bundle`)

Otherwise, return composition metadata without resolving:

```javascript
if (!query.resolve && query.format === 'workbench') {
  // Return composition config without resolving
  return {
    id: snapshot.id,
    type: snapshot.type,
    snapshot_id: snapshot.snapshot_id,
    modified: snapshot.modified,
    version: snapshot.version,
    name: snapshot.name,
    composition: snapshot.composition,
    composition_resolution: snapshot.composition_resolution  // Pre-computed
  };
}
```

### 3. Parallel Component Resolution

Resolve component tracks in parallel:

```javascript
const resolutions = await Promise.all(
  composition.component_tracks.map(async (component) => {
    return await resolveComponentSnapshot(component);
  })
);
```

### 4. Deduplication Optimization

Use Set for O(1) duplicate detection:

```javascript
const seen = new Set();
const deduplicated = [];

for (const obj of allObjects) {
  const key = `${obj.object_ref}:${obj.object_modified}`;
  if (!seen.has(key)) {
    seen.add(key);
    deduplicated.push(obj);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Snapshot Before Tagging

Always create snapshot, review, then tag:

```bash
# Create draft
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/virtual/snapshots/create

# Review
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified?format=workbench

# Preview release artifact
GET /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release/preview?format=bundle

# Tag only when satisfied
POST /api/release-tracks/:id/snapshots/:modified/release
```

If composition changes after materialization, repeat the create step. Direct
member replacement through either standard-track `/contents` endpoint is
rejected for virtual tracks.

### 2. Use Scheduled Snapshots for Consistency

Define snapshot schedule up front:

```javascript
snapshot_schedule: {
  mode: "dates",
  dates: [
    "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    "2024-07-15T00:00:00Z",
    "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Document Component Versions

Add metadata to virtual track for documentation:

```javascript
{
  description: "Enterprise ATT&CK v14.0 includes:\n" +
    "- Groups Monthly v1.3 (47 Groups)\n" +
    "- Techniques Quarterly v2.1 (823 Techniques)\n" +
    "- Software Biannual v1.0 (450 Software)"
}
```

### 4. Monitor Component Track Releases

Set up alerts when component tracks release:

```javascript
eventBus.on('release-track:released', async (event) => {
  // Find virtual tracks that reference this standard track
  const virtualTracks = await findVirtualTracksByComponent(event.collectionId);

  // Notify virtual track owners
  for (const vt of virtualTracks) {
    await notificationService.send({
      to: vt.owner_email,
      subject: `Component track ${event.collectionName} released v${event.version}`,
      body: `Your virtual track "${vt.name}" references this component. ` +
        `Consider creating a new snapshot to include the latest release.`
    });
  }
});
```

## Limitations

### 1. No Event-Driven Snapshots

Virtual tracks do NOT automatically snapshot when component tracks release.

**Rationale:** Prevents snapshot explosion when many component tracks release frequently.

**Alternative:** Use notifications + manual snapshots, or scheduled snapshots.

### 2. No Workflow on Composed Objects

Virtual tracks cannot transition workflow status of composed objects.

**Rationale:** Composed objects are owned by standard tracks; virtual tracks are read-only views.

**Alternative:** If you need to change object status, do it in the source standard track.

### 3. Only Reference Tagged Snapshots

Virtual tracks cannot compose from draft snapshots.

**Rationale:** Ensures stability and prevents virtual snapshots from inadvertently including WIP content.

**Alternative:** Tag the standard track snapshot first, then create virtual snapshot.

## Error Handling

### Error: Component Has No Tagged Snapshots

```json
{
  "error": "NoTaggedSnapshotsError",
  "message": "Component track 'GroupsMonthly' has no tagged releases",
  "resolution": "Tag at least one snapshot in the component track before creating virtual snapshot"
}
```

### Error: Component Is Virtual Track

```json
{
  "error": "InvalidComponentTypeError",
  "message": "Virtual tracks can only compose from standard tracks. Component 'release-track--uuid-x' is a virtual track.",
  "resolution": "Remove the virtual track from component_tracks. Virtual tracks cannot compose from other virtual tracks."
}
```
