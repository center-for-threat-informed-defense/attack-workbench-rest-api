# ATT&CK Workbench REST API

The ATT&CK Workbench is an application allowing users to **explore**, **create**, **annotate**, and **share** extensions of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base.

This repository contains the REST API service for storing, querying, and editing ATT&CK objects. It is a Node.js application that uses a MongoDB database for persisting data.

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Create network
docker network create attack-workbench-network

# Run MongoDB
docker run --name attack-workbench-mongodb -d --network attack-workbench-network mongo:latest

# Run REST API
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d \
  --name attack-workbench-rest-api \
  --env DATABASE_URL=mongodb://attack-workbench-mongodb/attack-workspace \
  --network attack-workbench-network \
  ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api:latest
```

The REST API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, with API documentation available at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.
